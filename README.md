Deno learning project for the 2021 #AdventOfCode

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write script.ts
```
To warm-up and start learning Typescript and Deno, I made an initial script to download the challenges for each day (tested with last year's URLs). Run the command above to create a folder on the same directory for each available challenge. An initial file will be saved on each directory with the text from that day's challenge as a comment.
