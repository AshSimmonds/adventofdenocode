Deno learning project for the 2021 #AdventOfCode

```
deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write script.ts [YOUR SESSION COOKIE HERE]
```
To warm-up and start learning Typescript and Deno, I made an initial script to download the puzzle input and the first challenge for each day. Run the command above together with your session cookie from adventofcode.com and it will create a folder on the current directory for each available day. An initial file will be saved on each folder with the text from that day's challenge as a comment. It will also use your session cookie to download each specific puzzle input.
