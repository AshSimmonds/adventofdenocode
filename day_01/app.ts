 Day 1: Sonar Sweep 
To do this, count the number of times a depth measurement increases from the previous measurement. (There is no measurement before the first measurement.) In the example above, the changes are as follows:
199 (N/A - no previous measurement)
200 (increased) 1
208 (increased) 2
210 (increased) 3
200 (decreased)
207 (increased) 4
240 (increased) 5
269 (increased) 6
260 (decreased) 
263 (increased) 7
In this example, there are 7 measurements that are larger than the previous measurement.
